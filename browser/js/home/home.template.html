                <span class="md-subhead">Hey! I'm Daniel. My first name is actually Leon -- so you might know me by that -- but most people call me Daniel. Anyways. I'm a software engineer with specialization in the MEAN stack currently working at <a href="http://hicommon.com">Common Co-living</a>. I spent a year at Brandeis University studying Computer Science and Economics, but left when I realized that my passion was for the more practical side of CS -- not the theory I was learning in school. With that, I left Brandeis and enrolled in the <a href="http://fullstackacademy.com">Fullstack Academy of Code</a>, where I learned a lot -- both about programming and my own professional ambitions. I'm currently learning Ruby on Rails, and have React, Python, and Go in my sights.</span>
