### A little about the project
Welcome to my personal site. I built this website to showcase some of the projects I've worked on recently. I wanted the site to be dynamic, so I'd be able to quickly add content in the future. I toyed with the idea of each project having its own page with a longer description, but ultimately decided that people looking at the projects probably don't care to read an entire page's worth about each one, so I'm challenging myself to keep the descriptions short enough to fit on a card. I might change it later. Not sure. 

Anyway, the site is built on the MEAN stack. I used Angular Material to give it the good ol' Material Design feel, and a whole lotta flexbox to get things in the right place. I'm new-ish to flexbox, so I'm not sure if I used it according to best practices. 

This app was generated using [FSG](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/fsg), a fantastic generator built by [Joe Alves](https://github.com/joedotjs).

### Usage
Anyone can use this as a template for their own site -- the only static content on the site are the picture of myself, the description, and the links to my social media. Those can be swapped out and the rest is added dynamically. To build the app, make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Mongo](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/?jmp=footer) installed, and [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) installed globally. Once that's good to go, go into your shell, clone this repo, then navigate into the folder. Inside, run `npm install && gulp build`. Once that process finishes (can take 10ish minutes), open up a second terminal tab, still inside the folder. In the first tab, run `npm start` and in the second, run `gulp`.
